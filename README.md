### A High-Throughput Identification Pipeline for Promoter Interacting Enhancer elements



* HIPPIE is the workflow for analyzing batches of Hi-C paired-end reads in FASTQ format and predict enhancer&ndash;target gene interactions. HIPPIE streamlines the entire processing phase including reads mapping, quality control and enhancer&ndash;target gene prediction as well as characterizing the interactions.

* Check our [website] (http://wanglab.pcbi.upenn.edu/hippie/) for instruction of installation and usage.
